# Indexes

>Indexes refer to ways to structure documents so that LLMs can best interact with them.

>The most common way that indexes are used in chains is in a “retrieval” step. This step refers to taking a user’s query and returning the most relevant documents. We draw this distinction because (1) an index can be used for other things besides retrieval, and (2) retrieval can use other logic besides an index to find relevant documents. We therefore have a concept of a Retriever interface - this is the interface that most chains work with.
