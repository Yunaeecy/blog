## Overview

SIMD stands for <mark style="color:red;">**Single Instruction Multiple Data**</mark>. It is <mark style="color:blue;">**a type of parallel processing**</mark> that <mark style="color:red;">**allows a single instruction to be executed on multiple data elements in parallel**</mark>.

SIMD instructions can greatly increase performance when the same operations are to be performed on multiple data objects.

SIMD extensions are extra instructions that were added to the x86 architecture to support vector-like operations, such as:

* MMX
  * Only worked on integers
* SSE
  * SSE floating-point instructions operate on a new independent register set
  * Arm Neon technology is an advanced SIMD architecture extension
* AVX
